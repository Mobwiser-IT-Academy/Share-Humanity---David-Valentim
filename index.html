            We are continually scouting and planning upcoming trips to new and
            previously visited locations. Check out our projects page to find
            out more about past and upcoming trips and sign-up to be kept up to
            date about upcoming events.<br /><br />
            Your involvement as a volunteer with Sharing Humanity begins in the
            planning phase of the project you are interested in. A simple
            screening process is required for all applications prior to being
            accepted as a volunteer for any trip. This ensures that you will be
            sharing this experience with like minded individuals. Each member of
            the group is not only consulted, but plays an active part of the
            decision process to develop project logistics, schedules, and R&R
            trips.<br /><br />
            <b>Fundraising</b> - Each project trip is given a set fundraising
            target. This covers room and board for all group members, materials
            for the project, transportation while you are in the project's host
            country/location, overall project logistics, and any R&R activity
            that has been decided upon by the group. Sharing Humanity has come
            up with a fundraising toolkit to help the group collectively reach
            its target and we work closely with you to not only think of ideas
            to raise money, but in most cases we help plan and execute as
            well.<br /><br />
            <b>What isn't paid for?</b> - Each volunteer is responsible for
            helping the group raise enough money to support the trip, and to pay
            for his/her own way to the project's host country / location.
            Sharing Humanity will handle the logistics once you arrive at the
            nearest airport with transportation, room, board, etc.<br /><br />
            Once you have joined your team members in the project's host
            country/location we will work together to finalize activities with
            our local hosts, enjoy local cuisines and cultures, meet amazing
            people all around us, and get to know our group of volunteers to
            create lifetime friendships. Each of our project team leaders has
            experience leading teams and trips to remote locations, and working
            with unfamiliar cultures and languages.<br /><br />
            If you have even the slightest desire for adventure, are interested
            in creating new experiences and friends, have a drive to do
            something good in this world - then consider joining Sharing
            Humanity on our next trip.

            <br /><br />
            <b>Senegal 2014</b>
            <br /><br />
            Our project in Senegal took 8 volunteers through the heart of
            Senegal to the town of Kolda. This is one of the few cities in the
            Casamance region that has been helping treat the victims of one of
            Africa's longest running conflicts. Sharing Humanity sponsored a
            program to train 30 landmine victims and other deserving candidates
            with basic computer skills and entrepreneurial skills. Students
            finish the 4 month program by obtaining secured micro-finance loans
            that allows each of them to execute a business plan that they have
            been working on during the course of the program. Additionally,
            Sharing Humanity helped sponsor two free clinics during the trip in
            which volunteers participated. One clinic served members of the
            nearby Leper community (Madinat-al-Sharif), landmine victims and the
            poor of the surrounding area. The other clinic served surrounding
            animals and livestock. In all, the two clinics served 300 people
            (filled 200 prescriptions, 105 pediatric consultations, 70 general
            health consultations, 65 geriatric consultations and 60 dentistry
            consultations) and 300 animals (including cattle, goals, sheet and
            chickens).
            <br /><br />
            <b>Bangladesh</b>
            <br /><br />
            Our project in Bangladesh took 4 volunteers all over Bangladesh.
            Starting in Dhaka, we took a bus to Dinajpur and a van to Thakurgoan
            where we painted a newly built school and spent time with the rural
            community there. After spending a few days playing games with the
            kids and learning to paint with brushes made out of locally grown
            Jute plants, we traveled to Chittagong to attend a dinner where
            community members from the school in Rangamati were in attendance.
            The trip was capped off with a trip to Cox's Bazaar - home of the
            world's longest uninterrupted beach. Sharing Humanity still has, and
            will continue to have, more projects in Bangladesh including
            building an additional classroom for the ABC Charity School in
            Dhaka. Please contact us if you're interested in helping or know of
            a project that would be worth our consideration.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Earlier Projects</b>
            <br /><br />
            Our earlier projects have taken us to Sri Lanka to work at an
            orphanage and to rural, southern India - Kaigal Falls located in the
            lush green elephant sancuatary nested between Andhra Pradesh,
            Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. In India, Sharing Humanity volunteers
            worked with a local group, KEEP KFI - who has been tirelessly
            working on protecting the forrest and educating the local tribal
            community's children, to build a school on top of the hill in Kotta
            Bunda.
